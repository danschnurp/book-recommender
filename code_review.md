# Code review for Book Recommender

## 1. File Path Handling
- The use of relative paths like `./Downloads/*` is good for portability.

## 2. Command-line Arguments
- **Issue**: Lack of a robust command-line argument parsing system.
- **Recommendation**: Implement `argparse` or a similar library to:
  - Improve user interaction
  - Allow for configuration options (e.g., input directory, output file)
  - Enhance script flexibility and usability

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Documentation
- **Issue**: Absence of EDA or comprehensive README with statistics.
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Add a separate EDA script or notebook to analyze the dataset
  - Create a detailed README.md with:
    - Project overview
    - Data statistics
    - Usage instructions
    - Sample outputs

#### 4. Similarity Measurement
- **Issue:** Only correlation is used for measuring book rating similarity.
- **Recommendation:** Explore more advanced similarity measures:
  - Implement K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) for collaborative filtering to provide more nuanced recommendations.
  - Consider using FAISS for efficient similarity search, especially with large datasets.
  - Explore other techniques like cosine similarity or Jaccard similarity for a broader perspective on similarity assessment.

## 5. Additional Suggestions
- missing requirements.txt to ensure which library versions to use:
```
pandas==1.3
numpy==1.25.2
```
- and `python` 3.9
